     <h2><b>Starting steps: Discovering HTML world</b></h2>
     <p style="color:darkgreen;">The assignement for the first week was to create a personal website and to
      make a proposal for my final project.
     This first week represented an opportunity to face with Informatics for the
     first time in my life (since I had never studied IT before) and to start becoming
    confident with the subject.
     There is a list of useful links that used during this week:

     </p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">w3schools.com</a></li>
 <li>link2</li>
 <li>link3</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Ubuntu 15.10</h3>
	<p>
	The first thing I was required to do to start this course clearly was to have
   a notebook.I'm sure no one would judge it a reason to be worried about but
    to me it represented the very first problem: recently I was using my brother's
  pc, since mine showed clear signs of death desire. <br>I've never been a geek, but neither
  I've been able to keep my notebook's safety at a decent level.
  So, thanks to <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtoscana2016/students/111/index.html">
    Matteo Sirizzotti</a>, a FabAcademy student of <a href="http://fablabtoscana.it/">
      FabLab Toscana</a>
      I resumed my 8-year old Asus F5Vseries, formatting it and installing
      <i style="color:red">Ubuntu 15.10</i> operating system.
      Then, I moved my first steps in using terminal commands and I installed
      <i style="color:red">Atom</i> to start writing HTML codes.</p>

    <h3>Atom & HTML coding </h3>
	<p>
I previously knew that approaching with the huge and unknown world of HTML wouldn't have
been easy at all, but I found great help on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">w3schools.com</a>
This site helps in learning, testing, and training HTML code writing, by means of a long list of tutorials,
divided by topics that also cointain areas dedicated to exercises. <br>The most efficient
way of applying what I learned was to start from a prewritten html file and gradually change it, according to
the commands I little by little discovered. <br>To do that, as I already said, I used <i style="color:red">Atom</i> :
it is a approachable text editor that you can easily use without ever touching a config file.
 Infact, it permits you to navigate easily among
directories and files thanks to the menu in the left part of the page and it's
 also possibile to work on several files at the same time, thanks to tabs.   </p>
 <p>
   The first command I learned to use was <b>" p "</b> that allows you to divide the page body into paragraphs.<br>
   It represents the first success I had in HTML coding and that's why I feel fond of it.
   That's how you must type it in the text editor:
 </p>

	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
	&ltp&gt;
	Your text here
	&lt/p&gt;</pre>
	</p>
	Result:
	<p style="color:black";>
	<b>Your text here</b>
	</p>

  <h3>Project Planning</h3>
  <p>
    As I said, at the beginning of the course I qas asked to put down some ideas about my final project.
    I wanted to make something concerning my main interests that could be useful
    at the same time, therefore I focused on nature and, particularly, on water need
    of plant.<br>So, I put together the problem of water waste and the common habit of domestic
    gardening and I aimed at inventing a system that everyone could easily have at home, so as
    so to improve the water issue on a large scale, starting from single persons's little care.
  </p>
  <p>
    Owing to my project ambition, I had to plan the steps that would have lead me to
    my goal in a rational way and even if that would seem quite simple, I must admit
    it's not like that, since I still don't know definitely the items I'll have to
    create and how I'll do it. Therefore, having no ideas about time, procedures and
    difficulties, I had to find a method to face the process of my project realization.
  </p>
  <p>
    I discovered that plans can be made by and follow paths that can be the opposite
    one from another. After achieving a brief knowledge about the main ones and their
    principles, I set up my work according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model">The Spiral Model </a>.
    This planning method proceeds with evolving cycles that, one by one, enhance the starting
    prototype structure and functionality.<br>This picture clearly represents how
    the project grow as the process goes on.
    <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spiral_model_(Boehm,_1988).svg">
    The characteristics I found more suitable with my work were:
    <ul>
      <li>definition of the objective</li>
      <li>concepts of requirements and operations</li>
      <li>testing of the prototype at each cycle</li>
      <li>considerations and possible improvements of the prototype</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
        Infact, doing so, I think I'll better understand my project weak spots and potentialities
    during its realization, without compromising its functionality.
